Bulgogi Hoagies from J Kenji Lopez-Alt's youtube

1 tablespoon vegetable oil
5 ounces thinly sliced steak
2 ounces chopped kimchi
1 ounce chopped pickled peppers (such as the pickled fresnos you can find on this channel, or store-bought pickled cherry peppers or pepperocini)
2 slices American cheese
Large pinch Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
Small pinch cayenne pepper
A few grind black pepper
Large pinch black or golden sesame seeds
Kosher salt
A soft hoagie roll (French or Italian torpedo rolls from the supermarket, or whatever roll you can find. Not too crusty.), split 2/3-of the way through and opened.

Heat vegetable oil on a griddle or a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add meat and chop and stir it up with a stiff metal spatula as it cooks. When about half the meat is no longer pink, add the kimchi, pickled peppers, chili flakes, cayenne, black pepper, sesame seeds and kosher salt to taste. Continue chopping, stirring, and cooking until the meat is no longer pink. Make it into a bun-sized pile, then add the cheese. Fold the cheese in a little, then place the opened face of the bread over the meat/cheese mixture. Pick everything up with the spatula, and flip it over so that the filling is in  the bread. Pick up any stray bits from the griddle and pile them into the roll. Close the sandwich and eat it with napkins.
